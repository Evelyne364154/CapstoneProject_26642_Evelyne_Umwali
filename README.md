### Phase 2

### ✅ 1. Define the Scope
### Business Process:
# Biometric-Based Transaction Authorization System

## 📜 Description:
This process outlines how a financial or institutional system uses biometric data (such as fingerprint, facial recognition, or iris scan) to authorize transactions securely. The process ensures that only verified users can initiate or approve sensitive operations, especially in banking, healthcare, or government service platforms.

Objectives:

- Authenticate users with high accuracy using biometric data.

- Prevent unauthorized transactions and reduce fraud.

- Integrate with MIS to log and monitor transaction histories.

- Enable seamless and secure customer service workflows.

## 🪶 Expected Outcomes:

- Enhanced security and user authentication.

- Reduced transaction fraud and impersonation.

- Improved decision-making through accurate transaction logs and biometric reports.

- Streamlined and auditable approval workflows.
  
## ✅ 2. Identify Key Entities

Entity	Role / Description

- Customer/User	Initiates the transaction and provides biometric input.
  
- Authentication_logs: Validates the biometric input against stored biometric records.
  
- Biometric_data:keeps biometric input (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition).
  
- Transactions: Executes the transaction if authorization is successful.

## 🎨 Swimlanes to Use

Organize your diagram using the following swimlanes:

- User – Initiates transactions and provides biometric input.

- Biometric Verification System – Handles biometric data matching.

- Transaction Processor – Authorizes and executes transactions.

- Authentication Log Table – Stores success/failure attempts.

- Biometric Data Table – Stores registered biometric data.
