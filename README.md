### Phase I

# BIOMETRIC BASED TRANSACTION SYSTEM

In an era where digital transactions are at the core of daily operations across financial, healthcare, educational, and government sectors, ensuring secure and reliable authorization methods has become critical. Traditional security approaches—such as PINs, passwords, and security tokens—are increasingly vulnerable to breaches, identity theft, and social engineering attacks. To address these challenges, the Biometric-Based Transaction Authorization System offers a modern, robust, and user-friendly solution.

This system leverages biometric technologies—such as fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and iris detection—to authenticate users based on unique physiological traits. Unlike conventional methods, biometrics provide an inherent level of security that is difficult to replicate or steal. The system is designed to authorize sensitive transactions by verifying the identity of users in real-time, ensuring that only legitimate individuals can complete critical operations.

The Biometric-Based Transaction Authorization System not only enhances the security of transactions but also streamlines the user experience by eliminating the need to remember complex credentials. Whether deployed in banks to prevent financial fraud, in hospitals to safeguard patient data, or in universities to protect academic integrity, the system adapts to diverse environments where authentication matters most.

By integrating advanced biometric authentication mechanisms, this system aims to redefine trust and security in digital transactions, ensuring privacy, accuracy, and compliance with modern data protection standards.

##### Problem Statement

Traditional transaction authorization methods—such as passwords, PINs, and security tokens—are vulnerable to security breaches, identity theft, and human error. These methods lack robust verification of a user’s identity, especially in high-risk sectors involving sensitive or high-value transactions. The absence of strong authentication mechanisms increases the risk of fraud and unauthorized access to financial or confidential data.

##### Context

This system is intended for use in environments where secure, fast, and reliable transaction authorization is critical. Target sectors include:

Banks and financial institutions for customer identity verification during high-value transactions.

Hospitals and healthcare systems for secure access to patient records and authorization of critical medical procedures.

Government offices for validating citizen identity in public service transactions.

Universities and educational institutions for secure student or staff transactions (e.g., exam registrations, access to digital resources).

The system can be integrated into both physical point-of-sale systems and online transaction platforms, ensuring versatility in deployment.

##### Target Users

Bank customers and staff performing or validating transactions.

Healthcare professionals accessing or updating medical records.

Government service agents and citizens involved in secure service delivery.

Students, faculty, and administrators engaging in digital academic services.

Business employees and clients requiring secure login and authorization for enterprise transactions.

##### Project Goals

Enhance Security: Replace weak password/PIN-based authentication with unique biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition).

Prevent Fraud: Minimize impersonation, unauthorized access, and transaction tampering through multi-factor biometric verification.

Improve User Experience: Provide fast, seamless, and user-friendly authorization without remembering credentials.

Ensure Data Integrity and Privacy: Implement encrypted storage and secure transmission of biometric data to comply with data protection regulations.

Support Audit and Monitoring: Log and trace every transaction authorization attempt for accountability and legal compliance.


### Phase II

### 👌🏽 1. Define the Scope

### Business Process:

## 📜 Description:
This process outlines how a financial or institutional system uses biometric data (such as fingerprint, facial recognition, or iris scan) to authorize transactions securely. The process ensures that only verified users can initiate or approve sensitive operations, especially in banking, healthcare, or government service platforms.

Objectives:

- Authenticate users with high accuracy using biometric data.

- Prevent unauthorized transactions and reduce fraud.

- Integrate with MIS to log and monitor transaction histories.

- Enable seamless and secure customer service workflows.

## 🪶 Expected Outcomes:

- Enhanced security and user authentication.

- Reduced transaction fraud and impersonation.

- Improved decision-making through accurate transaction logs and biometric reports.

- Streamlined and auditable approval workflows.
  
## 👌🏽 2. Identify Key Entities

Entity	Role / Description

- Customer/User	Initiates the transaction and provides biometric input.
  
- Authentication_logs: Validates the biometric input against stored biometric records.
  
- Biometric_data:keeps biometric input (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition).
  
- Transactions: Executes the transaction if authorization is successful.

## 🎨 Swimlanes to Use

Organize your diagram using the following swimlanes:

- User – Initiates transactions and provides biometric input.

- Biometric Verification System – Handles biometric data matching.

- Transaction Processor – Authorizes and executes transactions.

- Authentication Log Table – Stores success/failure attempts.

- Biometric Data Table – Stores registered biometric data.

## 📘 Explanation of the BPMN Diagram

#### 👌🏽 Main Components and Their Interactions.

The diagram consists of four swimlanes representing key entities: User, Transaction System, Biometric Data Table, and Authentication Logs Table. The process begins when a User initiates a transaction, triggering the system to request biometric authentication. The Transaction System captures the user’s biometric input and queries the Biometric Data Table to verify it against stored biometric templates.

A decision gateway evaluates whether the input matches. If authentication is successful, the transaction is processed, and a success log is recorded in the Authentication Logs Table. If the match fails, the transaction is rejected, and a failure log is created. The process then ends by notifying the user of the outcome.

#### 👌🏽 How the Process Supports MIS Functions

This process directly contributes to Management Information Systems (MIS) by:

Enhancing Decision-Making: Each authentication attempt is logged, allowing administrators and auditors to make informed decisions using historical data.

Streamlining Operations: The biometric system automates identity verification, reducing the time and errors associated with manual approvals.

Data Integration: Real-time logs feed into the MIS database, supporting dashboards and analytics tools that monitor user activity and security trends.

#### 👌🏽 Importance for Organizational Efficiency
Implementing biometric-based authorization reduces fraud and unauthorized access, thereby increasing trust and security. It ensures that only verified users can complete sensitive transactions, which improves both data integrity and operational reliability. Furthermore, automation reduces reliance on human verification, thereby lowering overhead and speeding up processes.

This system also enables real-time monitoring, giving managers access to accurate, up-to-date information for faster incident response and better resource allocation—key goals of any modern MIS.

### Phase III

### 🔃 2. Relationships & Constraints

#### Relationships
| From Entity | To Entity         | Relationship Type | Description                              |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| User        | BiometricData     | One-to-One        | One biometric profile per user           |
| User        | Transaction       | One-to-Many       | Users can perform multiple transactions  |
| Transaction | AuthenticationLog | One-to-One        | Log created per transaction attempt      |
| User        | AuthenticationLog | One-to-Many       | Logs tied to user's transaction attempts |


#### Constraints

- email, phone_number → UNIQUE NOT NULL

- biometric_hash → NOT NULL

- status in Transaction → ENUM (Pending, Approved, Failed)

- status in AuthenticationLog → ENUM (Success, Failure)

- amount → CHECK (amount > 0)

### 📩 3. Normalization (Up to 3NF)

| **Form** | **Explanation**                                                                                    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1NF**  | All attributes have atomic values. No repeating groups.                                            |
| **2NF**  | Partial dependencies removed (e.g., in AuthenticationLog, `transaction_id` is full PK dependency). |
| **3NF**  | No transitive dependencies (e.g., user contact info is in `User`, not elsewhere).                  |

### 📘 4. Handling Real-World Data Scenarios

- Supports multiple transactions per user, but only one biometric record per user.

- Logs every transaction attempt with timestamp and result, allowing for auditing.

- Can handle authentication failures (no biometric match) and fraud analysis through remarks

#### 3 ▪ Integrity Validation Queries

##### Check each transaction has exactly one latest auth result.

```sql
        
SELECT t.transaction_id, COUNT(l.log_id) AS attempts
FROM   transactions t
LEFT JOIN authentication_logs l
       ON l.transaction_id = t.transaction_id
GROUP  BY t.transaction_id; 
```

![data integrity validation qeuries ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a40be81b-0787-4524-ad40-4cab50e5d77d)

#### Confirm no orphan biometric rows

An orphan row is a record that has lost (or never had)

If a row in biometrics points to an employee_id that no longer exists (or never existed) in employees, that biometric row is an orphan.

So “orphan biometric rows” simply means biometric-data rows whose foreign-key reference to the parent entity (e.g., employee, user, patient) is broken or missing.

```sql
SELECT user_id
FROM   biometric_data b
LEFT JOIN users u USING (user_id)
WHERE  user_id IS NULL; 
```
